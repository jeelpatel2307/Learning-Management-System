# Learning Management System (LMS)

The Learning Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to facilitate the management, delivery, and tracking of educational courses and training programs. It provides tools for instructors to create and deliver content, as well as for students to access and interact with course materials.

## Features

- **Course Management:** Instructors can create, organize, and manage courses, including adding lectures, assignments, and quizzes.
- **User Management:** Admins can manage user accounts, including registration, authentication, and role assignment (student, instructor, admin).
- **Content Management:** Instructors can upload and organize course materials such as documents, videos, and presentations.
- **Assessment:** The system supports various types of assessments, including quizzes, exams, and assignments, with grading and feedback features.
- **Discussion Forums:** Students can engage in discussions, ask questions, and collaborate with peers and instructors.
- **Progress Tracking:** Students and instructors can track progress through courses, view grades, and access completion certificates.
- **Notifications:** Automated notifications for course updates, upcoming deadlines, and other important events.

## How to Use

1. **User Registration/Login:** Users can create new accounts or log in to existing ones.
2. **Course Enrollment:** Students can browse available courses and enroll in desired ones.
3. **Course Interaction:** Students can access course materials, complete assignments, take quizzes, and participate in discussions.
4. **Assessment:** Instructors can create assessments, grade submissions, and provide feedback to students.
5. **Progress Tracking:** Users can track their progress, view grades, and monitor completion status for enrolled courses.

## Example Code

Below is a simplified example of how the Learning Management System might work:

```python
class Course:
    def __init__(self, title, instructor, description):
        self.title = title
        self.instructor = instructor
        self.description = description
        self.lectures = []
        self.assignments = []
        self.quizzes = []

    def add_lecture(self, lecture):
        self.lectures.append(lecture)

    def add_assignment(self, assignment):
        self.assignments.append(assignment)

    def add_quiz(self, quiz):
        self.quizzes.append(quiz)

class User:
    def __init__(self, username, email, role):
        self.username = username
        self.email = email
        self.role = role

class Student(User):
    def __init__(self, username, email):
        super().__init__(username, email, "student")
        self.courses_enrolled = []

    def enroll_course(self, course):
        self.courses_enrolled.append(course)

class Instructor(User):
    def __init__(self, username, email):
        super().__init__(username, email, "instructor")

    def create_course(self, title, description):
        return Course(title, self, description)

# Usage example
student1 = Student("student1", "student1@example.com")
instructor1 = Instructor("instructor1", "instructor1@example.com")

course1 = instructor1.create_course("Python Programming", "Learn Python programming basics")
course1.add_lecture("Introduction to Python")
course1.add_assignment("Python Exercise 1")

student1.enroll_course(course1)

print(f"{student1.username} enrolled in {course1.title}")

```

## Next Steps

This example provides a basic framework for a Learning Management System. Further development could include:

- Implementing user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Enhancing course creation and management features for instructors.
- Adding support for additional content types such as videos, quizzes, and discussions.
- Implementing grading, assessment, and progress tracking functionalities.
- Enhancing the user interface for a more intuitive learning experience.
